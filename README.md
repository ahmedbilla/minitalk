# minitalk

minitalk is a C project that focuses on implementing a simple communication system using sockets. The goal is to create a program that allows users to send and receive messages over a network. The project typically involves two components: a server that listens for incoming connections and clients that can connect to the server and send messages.

Key features of minitalk:

Allows clients to connect to a server over a network.
Clients can send messages to the server and receive responses.
The server can handle multiple clients and send messages to each one.
The project provides valuable experience with networking in C, understanding socket programming, and handling communication between multiple processes over a network. It teaches how to manage client-server interactions, message protocols, and working with system calls like socket, bind, and recv.
